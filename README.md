To use, run the program (you can download the jar in the releases page on github), then press on file in the top left 
and then click download. To change the outcome of a game, find the game you want to change in the top table and double 
click on the winner column, make your edit and then press enter. The entered winner must be spelled exactly how it is 
spelled in the program, caps doesn't matter.
